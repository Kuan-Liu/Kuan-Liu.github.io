To specify categorical angle labels and ticks, we need to input character variable.\nBecause we specified theta to be categorical (representing variable Year), we need to define even breaks between 0 to 360 by the number of unique Years (6 years in this example) to place the angle labels.\n\nThis is controlled by setting period = 6 under the layout option of polar.\n\nThe interactive feature of plotly is super nice!

Methdological research in causal inference with longitudinal data\nI develop Bayesian estimation methods that permit causal inference in longitudinal observational studies using administrative databases with the following features, repeated measures, high-dimensional confounding, latent variables, and multiple outcomes.\nI have two completed projects under this theme:\n\n\nLiu, K. et al. (2020) Estimation of causal effects with repeatedly measured outcomes in a Bayesian framework. Statistical methods in medical research, 29(9), pp.2507-2519.\n\n\nLiu, K. et al. (2021) A Bayesian latent class approach to causal inference with longitudinal data. Statistical methods in medical research, Under Revision.\n\n\nOngoing projects under this theme:\n\n\nCausal analysis for time-varying treatment: a software review. (student project lead by Yutong Lu, BSc in Applied Statistics, this is a Data Science Institutes Undergraduate Summer Research Project)\n\n\nCausal analysis with unmeasured confounding under a Bayesian framework\n\n\n\n\n2. Design and analysis of observational study\nI am interested in studying and applying statistical methods on the design and analysis of clinical and public health studies of rare diseases and chronic conditions. Under this theme, Bayesian inference is an appealing framework: it i) provides a flexible framework for data augmentation and adaptive designs, ii) propagates estimation uncertainty and enables the modelling of latent variables, iii) allow direct probability summaries, and iv) can incorporate prior clinical/expert beliefs.\nI work with leading pediatric rheumatologists at SickKids on several projects using causal analysis to investigate long-term clinical outcomes of juvenile dermatomyositis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Currently, I am mentoring two graduate-level biostatistics practicum students working on some of these projects.\n\nLiu K, et al. (2021). Pilot study of the juvenile dermatomyositis consensus treatment plans: A CARRA Registry study. Journal of Rheumatology, 48(1): 114-122. doi:10.3899/jrheum.190494\n\n\n\n3. Causal inference methods for randomized controlled trials\nCausal inference methods have been applied to traditional RCT data to adjust for non-compliance. Newer trial designs such as pragmatic trials, with a focus on providing timely efficacy evidence, often do not feature complete treatment randomization and thus require causal inference methods to estimate causal effect. Under this topic, my research interests focus on methods for subgroup analysis including identification of patient subgroups and clinical phenotypes that have differential response to treatment."
